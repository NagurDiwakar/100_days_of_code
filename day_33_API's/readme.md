Api is just an interface that would combine software or group of software

Api is a set of commands , functions and protocols and objects that programmers can use to create or interact with the external software 

for example yahoo weather api which we can fetch the weather data from diff geographical locations , or coinbase api which will fetch out the diff types of coins

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API

your system. -->. API --> External system (we has to use the rules for external api interaction and respond accordingly with data )

http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/  --> is example for api interactioon (http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json)

for example you --> banker --> vault (here banker acts as an api to interact and respond with the queries and money you want to debit)

json viewer awesome - > chrome extension plugin to get the json data in color or tree form


why json response? - it is lightweight and easy to parse and read by humans and machines and easily transferable over network

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status -- http status codes

just to add teh each status code has its own meaning and purpose needs large number of lines to explain each one of them
https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/ -- restful api status codes
in python we have requests module to interact with the api's - https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/

pip install requests

understanding api parameters :
Bank Anology : 
You --> Banker (api) --> Vault (external system)
You want to withdraw 500$ from your vault
So you will give the banker (api) your id proof and request to withdraw 500$
The banker will check your id proof and process your request and give you 500$ if everything


Ex :  https://sunrise-sunset.org/api , you can see that some parameters are given in the url like lat , lng are required , some are optional like date and formatted
