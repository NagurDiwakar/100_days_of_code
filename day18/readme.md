# import modules and insttalling packages and work with the aliases

when importing always specific module import will help

for example 

import turtle  -->. when using this we always have to use as below module when referencing

my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()

## instead of that we can directly use the "from turtle import Turtle " --> my_turtle = Turtle()

or 

## from turtle import *. --> this has alot of cons (not recommended)



## aliasing the modules ... it will be helpful if any module name is very long 

import turtle as t

## some packages were not part of the python standard library , than we should install it

example : pip install heroes or pip install villians ( which are not part of the standard packages) when installed , it will be installed to local virtual env per project basis



# python tuples - we cant change the values (stone carved)
