# TODO :  [google developer yc vid - coding practices [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5RRxu7QBcvI]] -  clear and meaningful names,  comment to explain why not what  , write test cases , 


# TODO 1 : describe the problem [check and why it got happened]

# TODO 2 : reproduce the error - when is that particular error cames in [some bugs were sneaky only comes in certain conditions]

# TODO 3 : play computer and evalute each line [ex :  thoony helps to show which execute first and what will be next] go through line by line and check evalaute the code to figure out why its not workibg expected


# TODO 4 : fixing errors and watching the red underliners [ and check the particular errors are check with in the google ], lets say if u r giving invalid input ie int instead u have given str ... we can use the TRY and EXCEPT method instead just to panic 

# TODO 5 : SQuash bugs with the print statement [ during loops its difficult to see intermediate values , with using print will help u see the values ... ]

# TODO 6 : Debugger [isolate the module , and use the print statement ]

# TODO 7 :  Take a break , Ask a friend , Run often [ run ur code often dont wait till loads of written code] , ask stackoverflow
