print(1 + 2)
print(1 - 2)
print(1 * 2) #multiplication 
print(1 / 2) # devision always get the result in float
print(1 // 2) # it removes the numbers after dot [2.13 -> 2]
print(1 ** 2) # exponentiation

# the approach to follow when Evaluating the mathematical expression as below
# PEMDAS
# parentheses,exponents, multiplication/division and addition/substraction

# for equal moperations we can use the left to right approach

# ()
# **
# * or /
# + or -

print( 3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3 )

# in the above we are calculating from the left to right [ even though they have equal importance]

print( 3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3 )
