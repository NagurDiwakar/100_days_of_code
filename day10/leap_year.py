# Leap Year
# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª 
# Write a program that returns True or False whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year. 
# - on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# - except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder 
# - unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder   
# If English is not your first language, or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart.

# def is_leap(year):
#     if year % 4 == 0:
#         print("True")
#         if year % 100 == 0:
#            print("True")
#     else:
#         print("False")
