for the websites or resources with out any api , for data retrieval we should use scraping techinique called webscraping using the python libraries like beautiful_soup


https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

usally  requests library  is to get the data as mentioned in the example

webscraping is legal and illegal

for a every website there are things which are allowed or disallowed

ex :  https://example.com/robots.txt

Some sites are  having setup captcha or human intervention during website visit (for entripises cloudflare is wenabled for the websites as example)

Main reason to setup above to prevent bot traffic (and client rate limit ) ( how many requests should be passed in a minute)
