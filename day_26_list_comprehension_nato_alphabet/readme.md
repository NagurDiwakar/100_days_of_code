List and dictionary comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

Dictionary comprehensions are similar to list comprehensions but allow you to create dictionaries in a single line of code.

lists comprehensions can be done on below using strings, ranges, tuples, sets , dictionaries and list as well.:
1. for loops
2. if else conditions   
3. nested for loops
4. nested if else conditions
