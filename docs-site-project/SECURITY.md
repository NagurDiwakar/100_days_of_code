# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Documentation Site:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: **[Your Security Email]**

Or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill out the form with details

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact** - Potential impact and affected components
- **Reproduction** - Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment** - OS, Python version, browser details
- **Proof of Concept** - Code or screenshots (if applicable)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## Security Measures

### 🔐 Built-in Security Features

Our documentation site includes several security measures:

- **Input Sanitization** - All user inputs are sanitized
- **CSRF Protection** - Cross-site request forgery protection
- **Content Security Policy** - XSS protection headers
- **Secure Headers** - Security-focused HTTP headers
- **File Upload Restrictions** - Limited to safe file types
- **Rate Limiting** - API endpoint protection

### 🔍 Automated Security Scanning

We use automated tools for security:

- **Dependabot** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL** - Static code analysis
- **Trivy** - Container image scanning
- **Safety** - Python dependency security check
- **Bandit** - Python security linting

### 🐳 Container Security

For Docker deployments:

- **Minimal Base Images** - Using slim/alpine variants
- **Non-root User** - Containers run as non-root
- **Read-only Filesystem** - Where possible
- **Security Scanning** - Regular image vulnerability scans

## Security Best Practices

### 🚀 Deployment Security

When deploying the documentation site:

1. **Use HTTPS** - Always deploy with SSL/TLS
2. **Environment Variables** - Use env vars for sensitive config
3. **Access Control** - Implement proper authentication if needed
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring** - Set up security monitoring and logging

### 🔧 Configuration Security

```yaml
# Example secure configuration
security:
  csrf_enabled: true
  secure_headers: true
  upload_restrictions: true
  rate_limiting: true
```

### 🗂️ File Permissions

Ensure proper file permissions:
```bash
# Configuration files
chmod 600 site_config.yaml

# Documentation directory
chmod 755 docs/
chmod 644 docs/*.md

# Application files
chmod 644 *.py
chmod 755 deploy.py
```

## Known Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Development vs Production

**Development Mode Warnings:**
- Debug mode should be disabled in production
- Default secret keys should be changed
- Development servers should not be exposed publicly

**Production Checklist:**
- [ ] `FLASK_DEBUG=0`
- [ ] Custom secret key set
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Access logging enabled

### 🔐 Authentication

Current version includes:
- ✅ Basic document protection
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ❌ User authentication (planned)
- ❌ Role-based access (planned)

For production use with sensitive documentation:
1. Implement authentication layer
2. Use reverse proxy with auth
3. Deploy in private network
4. Use VPN access

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

### 🕐 Process

1. **Report Received** - Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Initial Triage** - Within 48 hours
3. **Severity Assessment** - Within 7 days
4. **Fix Development** - Timeframe based on severity
5. **Testing** - Thorough testing of fixes
6. **Release** - Security update released
7. **Public Disclosure** - 90 days after fix or with reporter agreement

### 📊 Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Critical | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution |
| High | 3-7 days | Data exposure |
| Medium | 14 days | XSS vulnerabilities |
| Low | 30 days | Information disclosure |
