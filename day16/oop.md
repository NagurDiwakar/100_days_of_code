# with in the procedural programming where we define list of the variables and explaination to it , and its more of the lenghthy program to understand function or variables that do particular things

# previously FORTRAN, COBOL comes under the procedural programming

# with the increasing complexity of the procedural programming , where we can lengthy and relationship over all the program in almost of the complex projects 

# THIS IS WHERE OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING PARADIGM COMES REALLY HANDY

# LETS say for the self driving car has different capabilities needs to be added camera moduel , navigation , battery sensor , motionsenser etc to complete the prpject with different set of teams collaberation together  ... on top og that leads to most of the modules reusable

# oop - reusable modules with in the program ,with in large and complex projects
