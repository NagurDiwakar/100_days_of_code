When we have scenario 

more requirement of the more turtles we can usse the class as a blueprint and object can be considered to create the multiple instances of it

example:

Turtle is a main class

turtle_1 = Turtle()
turtle_2 = Turtle()
turtle_3 = Turtle()

and also added the color for them 

turtle_1.color = green
turtle_2.color = purple
